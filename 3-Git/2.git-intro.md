# Introduction to Git

# What is Git?

- Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel.
- Git is designed to be fast, flexible, and efficient, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project while keeping a detailed history of changes.
- Git is a tool that helps developers keep track of changes in their code. 
- It allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other's work.
- Git also helps in creating different versions of the code, making it easier to fix bugs or add new features.
- It's like a time machine for your code, letting you go back to previous versions if something goes wrong.
- Developers often use platforms like GitHub or GitLab to share their code and collaborate with others.


# Git Lifecycle

When a directory is made a git repository, there are mainly 3 states which make the essence of Git Version Control System. The three states are – 

1. Working Directory
2. Staging Area
3. Git Directory

**1. Working Directory**

- Whenever we want to initialize our local project directory to make it a git repository, we use the **`git init`** command. After this command, git becomes aware of the files in the project although it doesn’t track the files yet. The files are further tracked in the staging area.
- Consider a project residing in your local system. This project may or may not be tracked by Git. In either case, this project directory is called your Working directory.
- Working directory is the directory containing hidden **`.git`** folder.

**2. Staging Area**

- Now, to track the different versions of our files we use the command **`git add`**. 
- While we're in the working directory, we select the files that have to be tracked by Git.
- We do not specify all files to be tracked in git, because some files could be temporary data which is being generated while execution.
- In other words, staging area is the playground where you group, add and organize the files to be committed to Git for tracking their versions.


**3. Git Directory**

- Now since we have all the files that are to be tracked and are ready in the staging area, we are ready to commit our files using the git commit command.
- Commit helps us in keeping the track of the metadata of the files in our staging area. We specify every commit with a message which tells what the commit is about.
- Git preserves the information or the metadata of the files that were committed in a Git Directory which helps Git in tracking files and basically it preserves the photocopy of the committed files.
- Note: **`git commit -m "your message"`** - Command to commit files to Git repository with message.
