# Introduction to Git

# What is Git?

- Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel.
- Git is designed to be fast, flexible, and efficient, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project while keeping a detailed history of changes.
- Git is a tool that helps developers keep track of changes in their code. 
- It allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other's work.
- Git also helps in creating different versions of the code, making it easier to fix bugs or add new features.
- It's like a time machine for your code, letting you go back to previous versions if something goes wrong.
- Developers often use platforms like GitHub or GitLab to share their code and collaborate with others.


# Git Lifecycle

When a directory is made a git repository, there are mainly 3 states which make the essence of Git Version Control System. The three states are – 

1. Working Directory
2. Staging Area
3. Git Directory

**1. Working Directory**

- Whenever we want to initialize our local project directory to make it a git repository, we use the **`git init`** command. After this command, git becomes aware of the files in the project although it doesn’t track the files yet. The files are further tracked in the staging area.
- Consider a project residing in your local system. This project may or may not be tracked by Git. In either case, this project directory is called your Working directory.
- Working directory is the directory containing hidden **`.git`** folder.

**2. Staging Area**

- Now, to track the different versions of our files we use the command **`git add`**. 
- While we're in the working directory, we select the files that have to be tracked by Git.
- We do not specify all files to be tracked in git, because some files could be temporary data which is being generated while execution.
- In other words, staging area is the playground where you group, add and organize the files to be committed to Git for tracking their versions.


**3. Git Directory**

- Now since we have all the files that are to be tracked and are ready in the staging area, we are ready to commit our files using the git commit command.
- Commit helps us in keeping the track of the metadata of the files in our staging area. We specify every commit with a message which tells what the commit is about.
- Git preserves the information or the metadata of the files that were committed in a Git Directory which helps Git in tracking files and basically it preserves the photocopy of the committed files.
- Note: **`git commit -m "your message"`** - Command to commit files to Git repository with message.


# How does Git work?

- Any project which is saved on git, is saved using a commit. The commit is identified using a commit ID.
- When we edit the project or add any new functionality, the new code is again committed to git, a new commit ID is assigned to this modified project. The older code is stored by git, and will be accessible by it’s assigned Commit ID.
- All these commits are bound to a **branch**. Any new commits made will be added to this branch. A branch always points to the latest commit. The pointer to the latest commit is known as **HEAD**.
- The default branch in a git repository is called the **Master** Branch.

But, why do we need a branch?

- Say, a developer has been assigned enhance this code by adding Feature A. The code is assigned to this developer in a separate branch “Feature A”. This is done, so that master contains only the code which is finished, finalized and is on production.
- Therefore, no matter how many commits are made by this developer on Feature A branch, it will not affect the Master Branch.
- Once the code is finished, tested and ready we can merge the Feature A branch, with the master branch and now the code is available on the production servers as well.

# high-level overview of how Git works

**Local Repository:**

Every Git project starts with a local repository. This is a directory on your computer where you initialize Git for version control.

**Staging Area:**

After making changes to your files, you stage them for commit. This means you selectively choose which changes you want to include in the next commit.

**Commits:**

A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. It includes the changes you've made and a reference to the previous commit, creating a history of changes.

**Branches:**

Git allows you to create branches, which are independent lines of development. This enables you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

**Merging:**

Once you're satisfied with the changes on a branch, you can merge it back into the main branch (usually master or main). Git automatically handles the merging process, but conflicts may arise if changes in different branches conflict with each other.

**Remote Repositories:**

Git is designed to support collaboration, and this involves working with remote repositories hosted on servers. Popular platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide hosting for Git repositories.

**Clone:**

You can clone a remote repository to create a local copy on your machine. This allows you to work on your local copy and synchronize your changes with the remote repository when you're ready.

**Fetch and Pull:**

Fetching retrieves changes from the remote repository, updating your local repository without merging the changes into your working directory. Pull, on the other hand, fetches and automatically merges the changes into your current branch.

**Push:**

Pushing involves sending your committed changes from your local repository to the remote repository. This makes your changes available to other collaborators.

**Conflict Resolution:**

Conflicts can occur when two or more people make changes to the same part of a file. Git will mark these as conflicts, and it's up to the developers to resolve them manually.


# Common Git Commands

**git init:**

Initializes a new Git repository, creating a .git subfolder that contains all the necessary files for version control.
```bash
git init
```

**git clone:**

Creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

**git add:**

Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area. It prepares the changes to be committed.
```bash
git add <filename>
git add .
```

**git commit:**

Records changes from the staging area in the repository's history.
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

**git status:**

Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
```bash
git status
```

**git log:**

Displays a log of all commits in reverse chronological order.
```bash
git log
```

**git pull:**

Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
```bash
git pull <remote> <branch>
```

**git push:**

Pushes local changes to a remote repository.
```bash
git push <remote> <branch>
```

**git branch:**

Lists all local branches or creates a new branch.
```bash
git branch
git branch <branch_name>
```

**git checkout:**

Switches between branches or restores working tree files.
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
```

**git merge:**

Merges changes from one branch into another.
```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

**git fetch:**

Fetches changes from a remote repository but doesn't merge them.
```bash
git fetch
```

**git remote:**

Displays a list of remote repositories.
```bash
git remote -v
```

**git diff:**

Shows changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.
```bash
git diff
```

**git reset:**

Resets the current HEAD to the specified state.
```bash
git reset <commit_hash>
```

**git stash:**

Temporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed.
```bash
git stash
git stash pop
```

**git revert:**

This command helps you in reverting a commit, to a previous version
```bash
git revert <commit-id>
```

**git rm:**

Removes files from the working tree and stages the removal.
```bash
git rm <filename>
```

**git tag:**

Creates, lists, deletes, or verifies a tag object signed with GPG.
```bash
git tag <tag_name>
```
