# Why DevOps?

Although, the software quality was improved using [SDLC](https://github.com/gul-ahmed/devops/blob/main/1_sdlc.md). We still had a lack of efficiency among the development team. 

- A typical software development team consists of Developers and Operations employees. Let us understand their job roles.
- A developer's job is to develop applications and pass his code to the operations team.
- The operations team job is to test the code, and provide feedback to developers in case of bugs. If all goes well, the operations team uploads the code to the build servers.
- The developer used to run the code on his system, and then forward it to operations team.
- The operations when tried to run the code on their system, it did not run!
- But, the code runs fine on the developer's system and hence he says “It is not my fault!”
- The operations then marked this code as faulty, and used to forward this feedback to the developer.
- This led to a lot of back and forth between the developer and the operations team, hence impacted efficiency.
- This problem was solved using Devops!
