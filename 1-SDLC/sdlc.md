# What is software development?

- Software development is the process of tranforming customer requirements into a complete software product.
- Software development is the process of creating, designing, programming, testing, and maintaining software and applications. 
- It involves a series of steps that aim to produce high-quality software that meets the needs of users or organizations. 
- The software development life cycle (SDLC) typically includes the following phases:

**Planning:** Defining the scope, objectives, and requirements of the software project. This phase involves determining the goals, budget, and timeline for the project.

**Design:** Creating the architecture and design of the software based on the gathered requirements. This includes defining the software structure, interface, data flow, and algorithms.

**Implementation or Developement:** Writing the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase involves converting the design into a working software product using programming languages and development tools.

**Testing:** Verifying and validating the software to ensure it works as intended. This phase involves various testing activities, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

**Deployment:** Releasing the software for use by end-users. This phase may also involve installation, configuration, and deployment of the software on target environments.

**Maintenance and Support:** After deployment, ongoing maintenance and support are required to address issues, fix bugs, and implement updates or improvements. This phase ensures the software remains functional and meets changing user needs.

# SDLC model

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model is a structured and systematic process used by software developers to plan, design, build, test, deploy, and maintain software systems. It defines the stages and activities involved in the development process, ensuring a methodical approach to creating and managing software applications.

## Waterfall model

- The waterfall model is the earliest and the simplest of all the SDLC methodologies. 
- The whole software development process is separated into phases, each phase beginning only when the previous one is completed.
- Every stage has its own project plan and relies on the information from the previous stage.
- The main SDLC stages of this model include gathering and analyzing the requirements, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and launch.
- Such a model is widely used in software development as it is simple to plan and manage.
- The process is also strictly documented and the processes and outcomes of each stage are clearly predefined.

**Advantages:**

1. The project requirements are clear, unambiguous, and detailed
2. The product definition is stable
3. The tech stack is predefined and not dynamic
4. Extensive resources with the necessary expertise are available
5. The project is short

**Disadvantages:**

1. Not suitable model for complex, long, and object-oriented projects
2. The product is integrated at the very process end
3. The team canâ€™t identify the possible problems beforehand
4. It is not suitable for projects that have changeable requirements
5. Adjusting the scope during the lifecycle may cause problems
6. High risk and uncertainty amount

## Agile model

- Agile is a modern software development methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.
- It is an iterative and incremental approach to software development, promoting the delivery of small, functional pieces of a product in short time frames known as iterations or sprints.

### Agile Methodology Characteristics

**Iterative and Incremental Development:**

- The project is divided into small, manageable iterations, typically lasting 1-4 weeks.
- At the end of each iteration, a potentially shippable product increment is delivered.

**Flexibility and Adaptability:**

- Agile welcomes changes in requirements, even late in the development process.
- The project adapts to evolving customer needs and feedback.

**Customer Collaboration:**

- Continuous customer involvement and feedback are crucial throughout the development process.
- Regular demonstrations and reviews allow customers to provide feedback and make adjustments.

**Cross-functional Teams:**

- Agile teams are typically small, cross-functional, and self-organizing.
- Team members collaborate closely, breaking down silos between different roles.

**Emphasis on Communication:**

- Constant communication and collaboration are encouraged within the team and with stakeholders.
- Daily stand-up meetings are common to keep everyone informed about progress and challenges.

**Advantages of Agile:**

**1. Flexibility and Adaptability:**
 Agile accommodates changes in requirements, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation to evolving needs.

**2. Customer Satisfaction:**
 Continuous customer involvement and feedback lead to a product that better aligns with customer expectations.

**3. Early and Incremental Delivery:**
 Functional increments are delivered in short cycles, providing tangible results early in the development process.

**4. Improved Communication:**
 Regular team interactions and collaboration enhance communication, reducing misunderstandings and improving project transparency.

**5. Risk Management:**
 The iterative nature of Agile allows for early identification and mitigation of risks.

**Disadvantages of Agile:**

**1. Lack of Predictability:**
 The flexibility of Agile can make it challenging to estimate project timelines and costs accurately.

**2. Requires Active Customer Involvement:**
 Continuous customer involvement is essential, and if customers are not engaged, the project may suffer.

**3. Not Suitable for All Projects:**
 Agile is most effective for projects with evolving or unclear requirements. For projects with well-defined and stable requirements, a more traditional approach might be more appropriate.

**4. Dependency on Skilled Team Members:**
 Success in Agile depends on having a skilled and self-organizing team. Without the right team, the benefits may be diminished.

**5. Documentation Challenges:**
 Agile prioritizes working software over comprehensive documentation, which may be a challenge in environments with strict documentation requirements.
