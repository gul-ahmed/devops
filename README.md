# What is software development?

- Software development is the process of tranforming customer requirements into a complete software product.
- Software development is the process of creating, designing, programming, testing, and maintaining software and applications. 
- It involves a series of steps that aim to produce high-quality software that meets the needs of users or organizations. 
- The software development life cycle (SDLC) typically includes the following phases:

**Planning:** Defining the scope, objectives, and requirements of the software project. This phase involves determining the goals, budget, and timeline for the project.

**Design:** Creating the architecture and design of the software based on the gathered requirements. This includes defining the software structure, interface, data flow, and algorithms.

**Implementation or Developement:** Writing the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase involves converting the design into a working software product using programming languages and development tools.

**Testing:** Verifying and validating the software to ensure it works as intended. This phase involves various testing activities, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

**Deployment:** Releasing the software for use by end-users. This phase may also involve installation, configuration, and deployment of the software on target environments.

**Maintenance and Support:** After deployment, ongoing maintenance and support are required to address issues, fix bugs, and implement updates or improvements. This phase ensures the software remains functional and meets changing user needs.

# SDLC model

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model is a structured and systematic process used by software developers to plan, design, build, test, deploy, and maintain software systems. It defines the stages and activities involved in the development process, ensuring a methodical approach to creating and managing software applications.

**`Waterfall model`**

- The waterfall model is the earliest and the simplest of all the SDLC methodologies. 
- The whole software development process is separated into phases, each phase beginning only when the previous one is completed.
- Every stage has its own project plan and relies on the information from the previous stage.
- The main SDLC stages of this model include gathering and analyzing the requirements, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and launch.
- Such a model is widely used in software development as it is simple to plan and manage.
- The process is also strictly documented and the processes and outcomes of each stage are clearly predefined.

**Advantages:**

1. The project requirements are clear, unambiguous, and detailed
2. The product definition is stable
3. The tech stack is predefined and not dynamic
4. Extensive resources with the necessary expertise are available
5. The project is short

**Disadvantages:**

1. Not suitable model for complex, long, and object-oriented projects
2. The product is integrated at the very process end
3. The team canâ€™t identify the possible problems beforehand
4. It is not suitable for projects that have changeable requirements
5. Adjusting the scope during the lifecycle may cause problems
6. High risk and uncertainty amount
